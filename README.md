## ✨ Features

### 🔥 Streak System
- **Daily streak** resets at midnight (12:00 AM)
- **1 warning** before streak breaks — miss 2 days = back to Day 1
- **Streak freeze** — protect one day per activation
- Streak affects your growing tree!

### 🌱 Living Tree (Result Tab)
- Starts as a seed on Day 1
- Grows from sprout → sapling → tree over 50 days
- Day 75+: Dense foliage appears
- Day 75+: Fruits start growing
- Day 365: Tree explodes with celebration 🎆
- Spring blossoms appear after 3+ streak days
- Frozen streak = tree bends dramatically
- **Every 50 days**: Upgrade medals (Wood → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond)

### 💧 Water / XP System
- Each habit completion = **10 gallons of water**
- Water poured onto tree after completing all habits (10-second animation)
- More gallons = faster tree growth

### 📝 Notes & Tasks
- **Notes** (like Google Keep) — free-form writing
- **Tasks** (checklist) — items disappear when done
- **Sheet** (like Samsung Notes / spreadsheet view)
- When ALL tasks done: "**Alhamdulillah!**" message + celebration
